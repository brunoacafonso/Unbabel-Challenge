# Unbabel Challenge
 Translation task assignment to post editors for Unbabel
 Unbabel translates text between a lot of different language pairs around the world. 
 A first text translation is done using machine learning and this translation is then edited by human post-editors, who verify the quality of the translation and 
 edit it in order to improve it as necessary.
 When translation tasks are assigned to Unbabel's post translation editors, two complaints have been arising:
 1. Clients complain that translation quality is not stable;
 2. Many post editors remain without translation tasks.
 We need a translation task assignment procedure that can address both complaints.
 The challenge is described in detail in the file 'challenge.pdf'.
